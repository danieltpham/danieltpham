# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Pham

I'm a data scientist and engineer with 5+ years' experience delivering production-grade ML systems, analytics platforms, and simulation tools across enterprise R&D, digital health, and academic research.

🔧 I build scalable, interpretable, and deployable solutions — from full-stack data platforms and AutoML pipelines to uncertainty-aware models for high-impact decision-making.

🎓 I’m nearing completion of a PhD in data science, focused on robust modelling and optimisation for complex bioprocess systems. My research has led to 4 peer-reviewed publications and 3 international conference presentations.

📌 Currently open to mid-to-senior roles in:
- Data science / ML engineering
- Applied AI / simulation modelling
- Data platform architecture
- AI in manufacturing, healthcare, or digital products
